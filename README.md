## 🔭 Overview

**AetherOrchestrate** is the **seventh functional dimension (provisional)** of the Aether family — a candidate architecture for **goal decomposition, task assignment, scheduling, dependency tracking, and routing** of work in multi-agent software ecosystems.

The Aether family currently comprises **six foundational dimensions**, each published as a preprint on Zenodo (**not peer-reviewed**):

| Dimension | Focus | Question |
|---|---|---|
| **AetherGit** | Storage and versioning | How are agent-generated changes stored, signed, and versioned? |
| **AetherFlow** | Integration and post-merge verification | How are changes integrated into a shared trunk and verified? |
| **AetherProof** | Specification and evidence | How are claims specified and how is evidence for them recorded? |
| **AetherMesh** | Distribution and consistency | How is state synchronized without a central coordinator? |
| **AetherGovern** | Authority and policy | Who is authorized to do what, under which policy, and how is authority revoked? |
| **AetherRuntime** | Monitoring and assurance | What are agents doing while they run, and how are anomalies contained? |

AetherOrchestrate asks whether a **seventh dimension** is needed:

> **What should agents do next, and how is work decomposed, assigned, scheduled, ordered, and routed without a central coordinator?**

The investigation follows a **falsification-first methodology**: before describing the candidate, it states **five failure conditions (F1–F5)** whose satisfaction would show that the candidate does not deserve to exist as a separate dimension.

| Release | What it adds |
|---|---|
| **v0.1.0** | The hypothesis and the falsification-first methodology (paper only) |
| **v2.0.0** | Reference implementation (`src/aetherorchestrate/`): 7 modules, 39 tests, 3 experiments; published on PyPI |

## 🪜 Seven-Phase Methodology

v2.0.0 was built through a seven-phase methodology. Each phase is documented in a separate file.

| Phase | Deliverable | File | Status |
|:-:|---|---|:-:|
| 1 | Architectural Specification | `SPECIFICATION.md` (431 lines) | ✅ |
| 2 | Invariant Definition | `INVARIANTS.md` (285 lines) | ✅ |
| 3 | Test Design | `TESTS.md` (312 lines) | ✅ |
| 4 | Simulator Implementation | `src/aetherorchestrate/` (7 modules, ~561 lines) | ✅ |
| 5 | Test Execution | `tests/` (39 tests, 39 pass) | ✅ |
| 6 | Experiments | `experiments/` (3 experiments) | ✅ |
| 7 | Release | `RELEASE.md` (101 lines) | ✅ |

**Why seven phases?** To avoid building ~1,100 lines of Python based on untested assumptions, then discovering that the architecture itself needs to change. Each phase constrains the next.

**What is not assumed:** CRDT, gossip, BFT, or AetherMesh.

---

## ❓ The Central Question

> **Is there a set of requirements for goal decomposition, task assignment, scheduling, dependency tracking, and routing in multi-agent software systems that (i) is not already specified by the six existing dimensions, (ii) does not reduce to verification or to governance, (iii) can be specified without reintroducing a central authority, and (iv) yields an observable benefit over existing mechanisms?**

The four clauses correspond to failure conditions **F1**, **F2 and F3**, **F4**, and **F5**. A negative answer to any clause is sufficient to reject the candidate as a separate dimension.

## 🔬 The Falsification-First Methodology

A typical architecture paper begins from a conviction that a component is needed and then specifies it. The risk is circular. AetherOrchestrate adopts a falsification-first methodology:

1. **No prior assumption** that the gap exists.
2. **No prior assumption** that AetherOrchestrate should be a separate project.
3. **Every claim** is tested against failure conditions (F1–F5).
4. The **final structure** (single, dual, triple, quadruple, or integration protocol) is determined *after* comparison.

---

## 🧭 Failure Conditions F1–F5

| ID | Claim under test | Status |
|:-:|---|:-:|
| **F1** | Non-redundancy | 🟡 Not falsified (R2, R4, R6 partly covered) |
| **F2** | Orthogonality to verification | 🟡 Not falsified (narrowly) |
| **F3** | Boundary with governance | 🟡 Not falsified (decentralized setting) |
| **F4** | Decentralizability | 🟡 Not falsified (with residuals) |
| **F5** | Observable benefit | 🔴 Untested |

> [!NOTE]
> **"Not falsified" is a weaker status than "confirmed". No condition is confirmed.**

---

## 📋 Requirements R1–R6

| ID | Requirement |
|:-:|---|
| **R1** | Goal decomposition: a goal can be decomposed into a DAG of tasks |
| **R2** | Task assignment: each task can be assigned to a capable agent |
| **R3** | Scheduling: tasks can be ordered in time respecting dependencies |
| **R4** | Dependency tracking: the task DAG can be maintained under concurrent updates |
| **R5** | Routing: each task can be delivered to its executor without a central router |
| **R6** | Partition tolerance: decomposition, assignment, scheduling, and routing remain possible when nodes are disconnected |

---

## 🏛️ AetherOrchestrate: Architecture

> [!NOTE]
> All of this is **hypothesis**: a design-level description offered so that the failure conditions can be applied to something concrete. The five layers are implemented in `src/aetherorchestrate/`.

### Monotone vs. non-monotone functions

The paper separates orchestration functions that can be realized **without agreement** (monotone functions, or deterministic functions of monotone state) from those that **cannot** (for example, enforcing at-most-one executor). This partition is the core of **F4**.

---

## 📜 Propositions P1–P2

> [!NOTE]
> *Status: Stated with proof sketches; **not machine-checked**.*

| # | Proposition | Status |
|:-:|---|:-:|
| **P1** | Determinism of Local Decomposition | Proof sketch |
| **P2** | Irreducible Coordination Window | Proof sketch |

**P1 (restated).** If admission of a decomposition delta is a deterministic function of the delta and its causal closure, decomposition deltas are inflationary additions to `S`, and each node selects the canonical decomposition by a deterministic rule, then (1) admission satisfies assumption A6 of [AetherMesh](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.24038038) and (2) once all deltas are delivered, every honest node selects the same canonical decomposition.

**P2.** In any decentralized coordination protocol, the coordination window at an honest node is bounded below by the time to form the corrective record, propagate it, and verify it. The window is strictly positive.

## 📊 Evaluation Design and v2.0.0 Results

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the v0.1.0 paper **no evaluation was performed**. The v2.0.0 experiments are **simulations** covering a subset of the proposed metrics.

| ID | Metric | Direction |
|:-:|---|:-:|
| **M1** | Decomposition accuracy | Higher is better |
| **M2** | False-positive rate | Lower is better |
| **M3** | Decomposition latency | Lower is better |
| **M4** | Assignment fairness | Higher is better |
| **M5** | Schedule feasibility | Higher is better |
| **M6** | Dependency-tracking accuracy | Higher is better |
| **M7** | Routing overhead | Lower is better |
| **M8** | Coordination window | Lower is better |
| **M9** | Convergence preservation | Must be zero |

**Baselines B1–B5:** no orchestration, centralized orchestrator, hierarchical orchestrator, consensus-based scheduling, market-based allocation.

**Scenarios S1–S6:** network partition, coordinator failure, agent churn, concurrent decompositions, compromised assignee, dependency-update storm.

### v2.0.0 Experimental Results

*From `experiments/*/results.json`.*

| # | Experiment | Metric | Result |
|:-:|---|:-:|---|
| 1 | Decomposition Accuracy | M1 | 10 goals; mean task count = 1.00; all acyclic ✅ |
| 2 | Assignment Fairness | M4 | Jain index = 0.8803 (expected 0.9174; 4% deviation) |
| 3 | Coordination Window | M8 | 5 scenarios; all positive; min 0.008 s, max 7.5 s |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are **simulation results**. No generalization beyond simulation is claimed. Baselines B1–B5 and scenarios S1–S6 are **not** evaluated in v2.0.0.
